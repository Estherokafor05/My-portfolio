About Me

I’m a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with 6+ years of experience testing and validating complex web platforms, APIs, and distributed systems. I specialise in automation-first quality strategies, integration testing, and building reliable test frameworks that scale with fast-moving engineering teams.

My focus is on preventing defects early, improving confidence in releases, and helping teams ship software that works reliably in production—not just in test environments.
